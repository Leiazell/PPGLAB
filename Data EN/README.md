# NORMOTENSIVE
The person with normal blood pressure shall be called normotensive. Some guidelines have designed a classification system for blood pressure in adults, which divides it into optimal (<120/80 mmHg), normal (<130/85 mmHg), or normal-high (Systolic 130-139 mmHg or diastolic 85-89 mmHg).

# PRE-HYPERTENSIVE
Prehypertension refers to blood pressure levels that are higher than normal, but still do not reach the threshold to be diagnosed as hypertension. Prehypertension is generally considered when systolic pressure (the upper number) is between 120 and 139 mm Hg, or diastolic pressure (the lower number) is between 80 and 89 mm Hg. It is a warning sign to take preventive measures and prevent the development of hypertension.

# HYPERTENSIVE
Hypertension is characterized by chronically high blood pressure levels, exceeding the limits considered normal. It is diagnosed when systolic pressure (the upper number) is equal to or greater than 140 mm Hg, or diastolic pressure (the lower number) is equal to or greater than 90 mm Hg. This condition increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other health problems. It is important to manage and control them through lifestyle changes and, in some cases, medication.
