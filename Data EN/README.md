# OVERVIEW
The data were obtained on an outpatient basis, implying that none of the individuals were hospitalized, and the collection was carried out in a laboratory setting. Each of the 56 records composed of 22 men and 34 women in the dataset contained a PPG signal for 2 minutes (or 120 seconds), all sampled at a frequency of 100 Hz (fs = 100 Hz). In addition, PPG signals were recorded and their blood pressure (BP) was estimated. The mean age of the participants was 52.48 7.16 years. In addition, information was recorded on the diagnosis of cardiovascular risk factors and the treatment received, if applicable. It is important to note from the outset that the purpose of this database is to support the development of approaches to estimating blood pressure by analyzing PPG signals.

# NORMOTENSIVE
The person with normal blood pressure shall be called normotensive. Some guidelines have designed a classification system for blood pressure in adults, which divides it into optimal (<120/80 mmHg), normal (<130/85 mmHg), or normal-high (Systolic 130-139 mmHg or diastolic 85-89 mmHg).

# PRE-HYPERTENSIVE
Prehypertension refers to blood pressure levels that are higher than normal, but still do not reach the threshold to be diagnosed as hypertension. Prehypertension is generally considered when systolic pressure (the upper number) is between 120 and 139 mm Hg, or diastolic pressure (the lower number) is between 80 and 89 mm Hg. It is a warning sign to take preventive measures and prevent the development of hypertension.

# HYPERTENSIVE
Hypertension is characterized by chronically high blood pressure levels, exceeding the limits considered normal. It is diagnosed when systolic pressure (the upper number) is equal to or greater than 140 mm Hg, or diastolic pressure (the lower number) is equal to or greater than 90 mm Hg. This condition increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other health problems. It is important to manage and control them through lifestyle changes and, in some cases, medication.

# Description

Record #: name of the record associated with each individual, 'PPG_subj_##" (where ## is the subject number).

Age: range between 44 - 65 years old.

Gender: Male or Female.

Diagnosed: 'y' for diagnosed, and 'n' for undiagnosed.

Treatment: 'y', is under treatment, on the other hand, 'n', isnâ€™t under treatment.

Systolic BP: pressure over the arteries when the heart beats (measured in mm Hg)

Diastolic BP: pressure between beats when the heart is filling with blood (measured in mm Hg)

Heart Rate: number of heart contractions for a given time (measured in BPM).

JNC: Classification by JNC 7 guideline (N = normotensive, E = prehypertensive and H = hypertensive)

AHA: Classification by AHA 2017 guideline (N = normotensive, E = prehypertensive/elevated and H = hypertensive)
